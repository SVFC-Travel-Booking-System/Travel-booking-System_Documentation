# Project Title: Voyage Liner Booking System

## A. Problem Statement:

Travelers lack a centralized, user-friendly platform that allows them to accomodate their request services conviniently, efficiently search, compare, and book travel services across multiple providers in real-time. The current fragmented system requires users to visit multiple websites or use different applications to complete their bookings, leading to inconsistent user experiences, potential errors, and missed opportunities for savings.

Service providers faces struggle with operational inefficiencies due to the lack of an integrated system that can handle dynamic pricing, inventory management, and personalized customer service. This fragmentation results in lost revenue opportunities, increased operational costs, and a failure to fully meet customer expectations.

However, while there are numerous platforms for booking flights and hotels, there is a noticeable gap in the market for specialized travel booking systems focused on tours via bus and car.

The system will allow users to search, compare, and book a variety of travel tours, offering detailed information about itineraries, pricing, and availability. By providing a user-friendly platform that streamlines the booking process, the system will cater to the needs of both casual travelers and tour operators, enhancing the overall travel experience.

According to P. Sharma, R. Singh, and S. K. Gupta (2018). "Online Travel Booking System: Challenges and Prospects. " International Journal of Advanced Research in Computer Science, 9(3), 28-33.
